Tech Stack:

WHAT: With the escalating concerns over traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and the increasing costs of individual transportation, there arises a pressing need for efficient and sustainable solutions. Our carpooling app seeks to address these challenges by providing a platform for users to share rides, thus optimizing vehicle occupancy and reducing carbon emissions.

HOW (technologies used): The development of our carpooling app(platform: android/mobile) is primarily executed using Android Studio as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with Java as the primary coding language. Leveraging the capabilities of Google APIs, various features such as real-time mapping, and location tracking are to be implemented to enhance user experience and ensure smooth functionality.
